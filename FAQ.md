# FAQ 🤔

### Are Women Techmakers meetups only for women? 👩🏾‍🤝‍👩🏼👨🏾‍🤝‍👨🏽
No! We are a very inclusive community, that is open to everyone (not only to Women). Our meetup group is always open to people of all backgrounds, regardless of gender, age, race, expertise, etc. - everyone is welcome!

### Are the events free? 🆓 🎉
Yes! As WTM is a community-driven program and we get a lot of support from Google and local companies all our events are free of charge. We try to provide some drinks and refresments as well as occasional swag. 
We are also occasionally able to provide free or discounted tickets for conferences.

### Is there a Code of Conduct 📜 🤔
We follow Berlin's Code of Conduct http://berlincodeofconduct.org 
The short version would be "let's be respectful and excellent to each other". 
If there is a need, feel free to contact organizers at the event or via Slack - reach out to Roxy-WTM-organizer.

### How often do you organise events? 📅 🎉
As often as we can! Community work, especially over a few years (and we are active since 2015!) sums up but we always try to maintain a regular cycle of meetups. 
We aim to organise at least one meetup per month plus one coding study group. Last year we organised 81 meetups and 4 study groups!

### My company would like to discuss a cooperation! ⌨️ 🏢
Awesome! Ping us on Slack to discuss further details. We are usually planned for a few months in ahead but sometimes we are looking for venues on the short notice.

### Who are the speakers? 🎙️👩🏽‍💻
We keep in touch with many amazing speakers from around the globe. Berlin is a very common destination, so if our friends and supporers are in town they reach out and we try to arrange a meetup. 
We also have many awesome speakers and supporters in the local area!
### I missed a [Sketchnoting] event. When is the next one? 😿
We do not repeat meeups on a regular basis. However, if we see that the format was well received in the community, we try to repeat it, but most meetups are one-time events with different speakers and topics.

### I am not a programmer 👩‍🎨 👩🏽‍🚒
Our meetups are open to everyone and newcomers are especially encouraged! 
Regardless of you want to switch a career or just learn something new and exciting - the tech industry offers a wide range of topics. Only last year we covered fascinating areas like product development, design, work-life balance as well Google Assistant and App development for complete beginners. Even if you don't know anything about a topic, this shouldn't discourage you - the doors are open to find out more about it. Our group aims to bring people closer to tech - it is up to you, how much this closer would mean.

### Do you have many newcomers on meetups or is it a same group of active members? 👥
There are always many new faces as well as some reocurring ones. We slowly grow a network of people who benefited in some manner from our group and get back offering support in organising new activities.

### I am looking for a job.. 💻
Sure, I can recommend the jobs channel on our Slack. Attending meetups and asking around is a great chance to hear about the company's culture or finding out about open positions.

### Coding courses? 💻💻💻
Last spring we had a few courses on mobile development where participants learned to build their first apps in Android, Flutter and also iOS. There was also a Javascript course, you can check the recordings here http://wtmberlin.com/javascript-crash-course/. We plan to repeat the formats soon, if you can offer any help (your expertise in one of those fields or venue), please reach out via Slack!

### Slack 💛
Slack is one of the main points of our community. Share info that might be relevant for the community, keep in touch with people you met on our meetups and add endless :party-parrot: emojis.
