# Women Techmakers Berlin
The Berlin chapter of Women Techmakers is part of Google Developer Groups. The chapter was founded in 2015 with the mission to make Berlin's tech scene more diverse and inclusive. So far we've organized hundreds of events, in cooperation with hundreds of local companies, for thousands of attendees. We are almost 5,000 members and we always keep growing!

The group is run solely by volunteers, ATM we are a team of 6 from different fields of tech, and we are working on our mission by developing the community we've created online and offline, organising tech (and more) meetups and free coding study groups, and sharing resources with our members.

Did you know: In 2018 Meetup announced us as Berlin's most active tech group! 

Women Techmakers Berlin is an inclusive community, that is open to everyone who follows [Berlin's Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org)

# FAQ 🤔

### Are the Women Techmakers events open only for women? 👩🏾‍🤝‍👩🏼👨🏾‍🤝‍👨🏽
No! We are a very inclusive community, that is open to everyone (not only to Women). Our meetup group is always open to people of all backgrounds, regardless of gender, age, race, expertise, etc. - everyone is welcome!

### Are the events free? 🆓 🎉
Yes! WTM is a community-driven program operated only by volunteers, and together with local companies who are our great supporters and partners, we're always making sure all our events are free of charge. Mostly drinks and refresments are offered, as well as occasional swag. 
We are also partnering with conferences and workshops, in Berlin and around the world, to provide free or discounted tickets for our attendees.

### Is there a Code of Conduct 📜 🤔
Yes! We follow [Berlin's Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org)
The short version would be "let's be respectful and excellent to each other". 
If there is a need, feel free to contact organizers at the event or via Slack - reach out to Anna.

### How often do you organise events? 📅 🎉
As often as we can! Community work, especially over a few years (and we are active since 2015!) sums up but we always try to maintain a regular cycle of meetups. 
We aim to organise at least one meetup per month plus one coding study group. Last year we organised 81 meetups and 4 study groups!

### My company would like to discuss a cooperation! ⌨️ 🏢
Awesome! Ping us on Slack to discuss further details. We are usually planned for a few months in ahead but sometimes we are looking for venues on a short notice.

### Who are the speakers? 🎙️👩🏽‍💻
The short version: everyone.
The longer version: We have many beginner and advanced awesome speakers and supporters right here in Berlin! If you want to give a talk or a workshop - please reach out.
We also keep in touch with many amazing speakers from around the globe. Berlin is a very common destination, so if our friends and supporers are in town they reach out and we try to arrange a meetup. 

### I missed a [Sketchnoting] event. When is the next one? 😿
We do not repeat meeups on a regular basis. However, if we see that the format was well received in the community, we will try to repeat it, but most meetups are one-time events with different speakers and topics.

### I am not a programmer 👩‍🎨 👩🏽‍🚒
Our meetups are open to everyone and newcomers are especially encouraged! 
Regardless of you want to switch a career or just learn something new and exciting - the tech industry offers a wide range of topics. Only last year we covered fascinating areas like product development, design, work-life balance as well Google Assistant and App development for complete beginners. Even if you don't know anything about a topic, this shouldn't discourage you - the doors are open to find out more about it. Our group aims to bring people closer to tech - it is up to you, what does this mean.

### Do you have many newcomers on meetups or is it a same group of active members? 👥
There are always many new faces as well as reocurring ones. We keep growing our network, and make sure everyone contributes something, and gets something. Don't be shy - say hi to new people in events, and make sure to stay in touch.

### I am looking for a job.. 💻
Great! You can post in our #jobs channel on [Slack (stick to the template!)](http://slack.wtmberlin.com/) as well as on our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1106085959408694). Attending meetups and asking around is another great way to hear about the company's culture or finding out about open positions.

### When is the next coding course? 💻💻💻
Ever since our very first year we've ran several different coding classes annually: Android, Go, iOS, JavaScript and more. All by tech leades from our community who volunteer to contirbute to our efforts, in partnership with local companies. So it's always free.
Last spring we had a few courses on mobile development where participants learned to build their first apps in Android, Flutter and also iOS. There was also a JavaScript course, you can check the recordings on our [website](http://wtmberlin.com/javascript-crash-course/). We plan to repeat the formats soon, if you can offer any help (your expertise in one of those fields or venue), please reach out via Slack!
