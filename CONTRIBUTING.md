# Contributor's Guide

As soon as you started working on some issue from this project: https://github.com/WTMBerlin/WTMBApp/issues, put the `in progress` label on it and change the status to `done` after it is ready. 
You can also assign yourself to the ticket if you want to commit implementing it.

Learning project crafted with love and Jetpack components :rocket:
We want to maintain a Kotlin codebase. Feel free to make pull requests, add issues or comments! 👨‍💻 👩‍💻

Some of the features are marked with `good first issue`. As this is a community app, I would be very happy to see the community members contributing.

General rule: aim to write nice code, commits. :tulip:

Protip: this app could be easily forked and adjusted for your community if you are present on Meetup :octopus:
