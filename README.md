# Women Techmakers Berlin App

### Women Techmakers Berlin 
Women Techmakers is a global Women Techmakers run by Google. All our events are free of charge, we are open not only to women, but to everyone who respects Berlin's code of conduct https://berlincodeofconduct.org 

### Meetup Assistant for Women Techmakers Berlin events :robot: 
This app was written as a learning project to give a practical overview over our events including:

- programming courses
- career advice
- workshops on technical topics and soft skills
- talks with inspirational speakers

### What can I find here

Our app fetches Meetup Events via Meetup API from https://www.meetup.com/Women-Techmakers-Berlin/ and displays the events including venue and description details as a clickable list.

#### Contributor's Guide

As soon as you started working on some issue from this project: https://github.com/WTMBerlin/WTMBApp/issues, put the `in progress` label on it and change the status to `done` after it is ready. 
You can also assign yourself to the ticket if you want to commit implementing it.

Learning project crafted with love and Jetpack components :rocket:

Some of the features are marked with `good first issue`. As this is a community app, I would be very happy to see the community members contributing.

General rule: aim to write nice code, commits. :tulip:

Protip: this app could be easily forked and adjusted for your community if you are present on Meetup :octopus:
