        We are active across social media. You can find all our events on Meetup.
        Slack is one of the main parts of our Community - it is a good place to connect with other members,
        offer positions in #job-postings that reach more diverse audience or announce free/discounted diversity tickets.
        For Twitter you can use #womentechmakers.</string>
