        At Women Techmakers Berlin we are encouraging diversity in tech in Berlin since 2015. Get visibility, networking and resources to make the tech community of Berlin diverse and inclusive!
        We have different activities: intense study groups, inspirational fireside chats and international events. New
        and existing members are always welcome to all of the events, and all events are always opened for everyone,
        regardless of your gender/age/race/experience, etc. We follow the Berlin code of conduct for communities:
