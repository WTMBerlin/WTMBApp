    <string name="accessibility_content_1">The icon below is a very simple toy. If you open the list of apps on your phone and switch the TalkBack, the default
        accessibility tool for Android apps on, you can explore its hidden functionality.
        \nTalkBack usage: tap twice to confirm and scroll sideways to navigate. Thanks to this exercise you can understand for your own this everyday experience for some
        people.
    </string>
    <string name="accessibility_content_2">TalkBack should be preinstalled, if not it is available in app store for
        free. Explore the app in the TalkBack mode and click on the image above will result with an additional
        functionality. We should be aware of needs of people with impairments, so I highly encourage you to try TalkBack
        out and to support accessibility features in your project. Adding basic accessibility to an Android app is very
        easy (for example for web development it is a bit more tricky but still quite straightforward), so after reading
        an article or watching some videos you can contribute to open source projects, hopefully with more meaningful descriptions than implemented
        on this one!
    </string>
    <string name="accessibility_content_3">Start with adding meaningful labels for custom designed elements (back arrow, check-marks, x)
        and set importantForAccessibility=no for design elements will not be useful for the user in the screen reader user mode. Provide
        content descriptions for pictures and elements (ideally descriptions that are more meaningful that the one
        implemented on the image above). Ah, and mind the text-background contrast. \nYou are good to go! For more resources visit:
